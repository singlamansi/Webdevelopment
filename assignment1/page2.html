	<center><b><font color="D23195" size=6><A name=net></A>Network Layer</font></b></center><p><font size=5>At the network layer (or, more accurately, the internetwork layer), TCP/IP supports the
Internet Protocol (IP). The Internet Protocol (IP) is the transmission mechanism used
by the TCP/IP protocols. IP transports data in packets called datagrams, each of which
is transported separately. Datagrams can travel along different routes and can arrive out
of sequence or be duplicated. IP does not keep track of the routes and has no facility for
reordering datagrams once they arrive at their destination. Figure 2.12 shows the communication
at the network layer.
Note that there is a main difference between the communication at the network
layer and the communication at data link or physical layers. Communication at the</font></P>

node. The datagram started at computer A is the one that reaches computer B. The network
layers of the routers can inspect the source and destination of the packet for finding
the best route, but they are not allowed to change the contents of the packet. Of
course, the communication is logical, not physical. Although the network layer of computer
A and B think that they are sending and receiving datagrams, the actual communication
again is done at the physical level.</font></P>

	<center><b><font color="D23195" size=6><A name=trn></A>Transport Layer</font></b></center>
	<p><font size=5>There is a main difference between the transport layer and the network layer.
Although all nodes in a network need to have the network layer, only the two end
computers need to have the transport layer. The network layer is responsible for sending
individual datagrams from computer A to computer B; the transport layer is
responsible for delivering the whole message, which is called a segment, a user datagram,
or a packet, from A to B. A segment may consist of a few or tens of datagrams.
The segments need to be broken into datagrams and each datagram has to be delivered
to the network layer for transmission. Since the Internet defines a different route
for each datagram, the datagrams may arrive out of order and may be lost. The transport
layer at computer B needs to wait until all of these datagrams to arrive, assemble them and make a segment out of them. Figure 2.13 shows the communication at the
transport layer.</font></P>


<center><img src="images/a7.jpg" height=40% width=65%></center>
	<p><font size=5>Again, we should know that the two transport layers only think that they are communicating
with each other using a segment; the communication is done through the
physical layer and the exchange of bits.
Traditionally, the transport layer was represented in the TCP/IP suite by two protocols:
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). A
new protocol called Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) has been introduced
in the last few years.</font></P>

	<p><font size=5>The application layer in TCP/IP is equivalent to the combined session, presentation, and
application layers in the OSI model. The application layer allows a user to access the services
of our private internet or the global Internet. Many protocols are defined at this layer
to provide services such as electronic mail, file transfer, accessing the World Wide Web,
and so on. We cover most of the standard protocols in later chapters. Figure 2.14 shows
the communication at the application layer.
<center><img src="images/a5.jpg" height=20% width=65%></center>Note that the communication at the application layer, like the one at the transport
layer, is end to end. A message generated at computer A is sent to computer B without
being changed during the transmission.</p><font>
