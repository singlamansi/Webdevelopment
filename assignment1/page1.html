	<TD><p><font size=5><A name=intro></A>In this section, we briefly discuss the purpose of each layer in the TCP/IP protocol suite.
When we study the purpose of each layer, it is easier to think of a private internet,
instead of the global Internet. We assume that we want to use the TCP/IP suite in a small,
private internet. Such an internet is made up of several small networks, which we call
links. A link is a network that allows a set of computers to communicate with each other.
For example, if all computers in an office are wired together, the connection makes a
link. If several computers belonging to a private company are connected via a satellite
channel, the connection is a link. A link, as we discussed in Chapter 3, can be a LAN
(local area network) serving a small area or a WAN (wide area network) serving a larger
area. We also assume that different links are connected together by devices called routers
or switches that route the data to reach their final destinations. Figure 2.9 shows our
imaginary internet that is used to show the purpose of each layer. We have six links and
four routers (R1 to R4). We have shown only two computers, A and B.</font></P>

	<p><font size=5>TCP/IP does not define any specific protocol for the physical layer. It supports all of the
standard and proprietary protocols. At this level, the communication is between two hops
or nodes, either a computer or router. The unit of communication is a single bit. When the
connection is established between the two nodes, a stream of bits is flowing between
them. The physical layer, however, treats each bit individually. Figure 2.10 shows the
communication between nodes. We are assuming that at this moment the two computers
have discovered that the most efficient way to communicate with each other is via routers
R1, R3, and R4. How this decision is made is the subject of some future chapters.
Note that if a node is connected to n links, it needs n physical-layer protocols, one for
each link. The reason is that different links may use different physical-layer protocols. The
figure, however, shows only physical layers involved in the communication. Each computer
involves with only one link; each router involves with only two links. As Figure 2.10
shows, the journey of bits between computer A and computer B is made of four independent
short trips. Computer A sends each bit to router R1 in the format of the protocol used
by link 1. Router 1 sends each bit to router R3 in the format dictated by the protocol used
by link 3. And so on. Router R1 has two three physical layers (two are shown in our scenario).
The layer connected to link 1 receives bits according to the format of the protocol</font></P>

	<p><font size=5>used by link 1; the layer connected to link 3 sends bits according to the format of the protocol
used by link 3. It is the same situation with the other two routers involved in the
communication.The responsibility of the physical layer, in addition to delivery of bits, matches
with what mentioned for the physical layer of the OSI model, but it mostly depends on
the underlying technologies that provide links. We see in the next chapter that they are,
for example, many protocols for the physical layer of LANs or WANs.</font></P><hr>
	<center><b><font color="D23195" size=6><A name=data></A>Data Link Layer</font></b></center>
	<p><font size=5>TCP/IP does not define any specific protocol for the data link layer either. It supports
all of the standard and proprietary protocols. At this level, the communication is also
between two hops or nodes. The unit of communication however, is a packet called a
frame. A frame is a packet that encapsulates the data received from the network layer
with an added header and sometimes a trailer. The head, among other communication
information, includes the source and destination of frame. The destination address is
needed to define the right recipient of the frame because many nodes may have been
connected to the link. The source address is needed for possible response or acknowledgment
as may be required by some protocols. Figure 2.11 shows the communication
at the data link layer.
Note that the frame that is travelling between computer A and router R1 may be
different from the one travelling between router R1 and R3. When the frame is received
by router R1, this router passes the frame to the data link layer protocol shown at the
left. The frame is opened, the data are removed. The data are then passed to the data</p><font>

<p><font size=5>link layer protocol shown at the right to create a new frame to be sent to the router R3.
The reason is that the two links, link 1 and link 3, may be using different protocols and
require frames of different formats. Note also that the figure does not show the physical
movement of frames; the physical movement happens only at the physical layer. The
two nodes communicate logically at the data link layer, not physically. In other words,
the data link layer at router R1 only thinks that a frame has been sent directly from the
data link layer at computer A. What is sent from A to R1 is a stream of bits from one
physical layer to another. Since a frame at A is transformed to a stream of bits, and the
bits at R1 are transformed to a frame, it gives this impression to the two data link layer
that a frame has been exchanged.</p><font>
