	<TD WIDTH=80%><center><b><font color="D23195" size=6>Introduction</font></b></center><p><font size=5>The TCP/IP protocol suite was developed prior to the OSI model. Therefore, the
layers in the TCP/IP protocol suite do not match exactly with those in the OSI model.
The original TCP/IP protocol suite was defined as four software layers built upon the
hardware. Today, however, TCP/IP is thought of as a five-layer model with the layers
named similarly to the ones in the OSI model. Figure 2.7 shows both configurations.</font><p>

<hr><center><b><font color="D23195" size=6>Comparison between OSI and TCP/IP Protocol Suite</font></b></center>
<p><font size=5>When we compare the two models, we find that two layers, session and presentation,
are missing from the TCP/IP protocol suite. These two layers were not added to the
TCP/IP protocol suite after the publication of the OSI model. The application layer in
the suite is usually considered to be the combination of three layers in the OSI model,
as shown in Figure 2.8.</font></P>
    <center><img src="images/a2.jpg" align=center height=70% width=50%></center>
<p><font size=5>Two reasons were mentioned for this decision. First, TCP/IP has more than one
transport-layer protocol. Some of the functionalities of the session layer are available in
some of the transport layer protocols. Second, the application layer is not only one
piece of software. Many applications can be developed at this layer. If some of the
functionalities mentioned in the session and presentation are needed for a particular
application, it can be included in the development of that piece of software.
TCP/IP is a hierarchical protocol made up of interactive modules, each of which
provides a specific functionality, but the modules are not necessarily interdependent.
Whereas the OSI model specifies which functions belong to each of its layers, the layers
of the TCP/IP protocol suite contain relatively independent protocols that can be
mixed and matched, depending on the needs of the system. The term hierarchical
means that each upper level protocol is supported by one or more lower level protocols.</font></P>
